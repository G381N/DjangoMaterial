# 📁 Django File Structure

When you create a Django project and an app, you get a bunch of auto-generated files. Here's what **every single file** does.

---

## Project-Level Files

These live in the root of your project:

### `manage.py`
The **command-line entry point** for your Django project. You use it to run the server, create apps, run tests, etc.

```bash
python manage.py runserver       # Start dev server
python manage.py startapp myapp  # Create a new app
python manage.py test            # Run tests
python manage.py shell           # Open Python shell with Django loaded
```

> You almost never edit this file.

---

### `requirements.txt`
Lists all Python packages your project depends on. Not auto-generated by Django — you create it with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

> 📖 See **[Requirements & Dependencies](./requirements_and_dependencies.md)**

---

### `.env`
Stores **secret configuration** (database passwords, API keys, etc.) that shouldn't be in your code or Git.

```ini
CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/
SECRET_KEY=my-secret-key
DEBUG=True
```

> You load these in `settings.py` using `python-dotenv`.

---

## Project Config Folder (`ProjectManagerCore/`)

This folder is your **project's configuration hub**. It's the "core" that ties everything together.

### `__init__.py`
Makes this folder a Python package. Usually empty. Required for Python to recognize the folder as importable.

---

### `settings.py`
The **brain** of your Django project. Controls everything:

| Setting | What it controls |
|---------|-----------------|
| `INSTALLED_APPS` | Which apps and third-party packages are active |
| `MIDDLEWARE` | Processing pipeline for every request/response |
| `DATABASES` | Database connection settings |
| `REST_FRAMEWORK` | DRF configuration (authentication, permissions, pagination) |
| `SIMPLE_JWT` | JWT token lifetimes and settings |
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Which frontend URLs can call your API |
| `ROOT_URLCONF` | Points to the root URL file |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Cryptographic key for token signing |

> 📖 See **[My Project → Settings](../my_project/my_project_settings.md)** for our exact configuration.

---

### `urls.py`
The **traffic controller**. Every request hits this file first, and it decides which app handles it.

```python
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('api/auth/', include('auth_handler.urls')),
    path('api/projects/', include('project_handler.urls')),
]
```

**How it works:**
- Request comes in: `POST /api/auth/login/`
- Django looks at `urls.py`, finds the `api/auth/` prefix
- Forwards the rest (`login/`) to `auth_handler/urls.py`
- That file maps `login/` to a specific View

---

### `wsgi.py`
Entry point for **WSGI servers** (like Gunicorn in production). You rarely touch this file.

### `asgi.py`
Entry point for **ASGI servers** (for async support / WebSockets). You rarely touch this file.

---

## App-Level Files (`auth_handler/` or `project_handler/`)

Each app has its own set of files. Here's what each one does:

### `__init__.py`
Makes the app folder a Python package. Usually empty.

---

### `apps.py`
App configuration. Django uses this to register the app.

```python
from django.apps import AppConfig

class AuthHandlerConfig(AppConfig):
    name = 'auth_handler'
```

> You rarely edit this beyond the initial setup.

---

### `models.py`
Defines your **data structures** (documents/tables). This is where you describe what your data looks like.

```python
# With MongoEngine:
class User(Document):
    username = StringField(required=True, unique=True)
    email = EmailField(required=True, unique=True)
    password = StringField(required=True)
```

> 📖 See **[Models, Views & URLs](./models_views_urls.md)** for more details.

---

### `views.py`
Contains the **business logic** — what happens when someone hits an API endpoint.

```python
class LoginAPIView(APIView):
    def post(self, request):
        # validate credentials
        # generate JWT
        # return response
```

---

### `serializers.py`
**Not auto-generated** — you create this yourself. Handles data validation and transformation between Python objects and JSON.

> 📖 See **[Serializers Explained](./serializers_explained.md)**

---

### `urls.py`
**Not auto-generated** — you create this yourself. Maps URL patterns to views within this app.

```python
urlpatterns = [
    path("register/", RegisterAPIView.as_view(), name="auth-register"),
    path("login/", LoginAPIView.as_view(), name="auth-login"),
]
```

---

### `admin.py`
Registers models with Django's built-in admin panel. Not commonly used with MongoEngine (since MongoEngine doesn't use Django's ORM).

---

### `tests.py`
Where you write **automated tests** for your app.

```python
class AuthTests(APITestCase):
    def test_register_and_login(self):
        # test code here
```

---

### `migrations/`
Stores database migration files. **Not used with MongoEngine** — migrations are a Django ORM concept for SQL databases. MongoEngine handles schema changes differently (MongoDB is schema-less).
